External 12V Power Supply Unit:
    Contributes Toward: 
        Power Subsystem: DC-DC Converter (Possibly a step-down buck converter)
            Wireless Microcontroller - Control system (Monitors Voltage/Current, communicates that data to our external display, etc.)
            LED or Hexadecimal Display - Displays whether a wireless connection has been established. Whether power is being integrated into the grid
            Thermocouples - Monitors the temperature of the panels
            Switches - Providing external control toward the interface box
            Monitoring Subsystem - Retrieves voltage/current data from the panels. If overvoltage/overcurrent occurs, implements safety precautions and shuts down completely
            Communication Subsystem - Capability of interfacing with multiple solar panels. Be able to select the combination of cells to output to the interface (32/64/128 cells)
            DC-AC Power Inverter - Transfers AC power to the external load (Must be load independent)
            
3 High-Level Requirements: 
    - Interactive Web Design
    - Wireless Communication Capability with the Solar Panels
    - Scalability
    
Subsystem Requirement: 
    - Manual Switch Control
