Working out the PCB design
On Wednesday September 22,2021: Kevin was able to take us up onto the roof and show us the design of the solar panels

10 boxes are already attached to the solar panels but are currently not harvesting energy to the grid. 
They are connected with a resistive load so output behavior can be observed and there is no storage capability so although they have the capability of transferring power to the 
grid, this functionality is not currently active.

Looking for additional parts to consider when creating PCB
  HiLetgo 5pcs DC-DC 12V to 3.3V 5V Power Module 3.3V 5V 12V Multi Output Voltage Conversion 
    - Converts a 12V dc input to 2 separate 3.3V and 5V dc outputs
    
Originally Considering XL7015 dc-dc buck converter module but it converts a maximum voltage rating of 80V to 5V. 
  - 2 Issues:
      - The open circuit voltage when operating at 128 cells exceeds 80V (85.6V)
      - There is no option to step down to 3.3V as needed for input voltage for the temperature sensor
      
Current Sensor: ACS723 
  The ACS723 sensor uses a Hall effect sensor to output a voltage relative to the current flowing through the IP+ and IP- pins on the board. 
The advantage of using a Hall effect sensor, specifically, is that the circuit being sensed and the circuit reading the sensor are electrically isolated meaning that, 
although your Arduino is running on 5V, the sensed circuit can be operating at higher DC or AC voltages. 
  The Current Sensor Breakout measures both DC and AC currents all the way up to 5A, has full electrical isolation of measured and sensed circuits, 
and has a base sensitivity of 400mV/A. Although the analog output is adjustable to 80kHz, the bandwidth on the ACS723 Sensor Breakout width filter has been set to 
20kHz to reduce noise when using at high gains. The full 80KHz bandwidth that the sensor is capable of can be recovered by closing the JP1 (Bandwidth Select) jumper 
on the back of the board.
  Note: Although the chip itself is rated for up to 2.4kV (RMS) of isolation, the board has not been designed for such high voltage applications.
