Looking at Wireless Microcontrollers and Arduino:
  ESP32 
      - Wireless Microcontroller (ESP32 MCU): Wi-Fi Connectivity within a large radius. Operates at a temperature range from -40°C to 105°C. 
          - Performs more accurate DC voltage measurements (Analog to Digital Converters with Higher Resolution) - Eighteen 12-bit ADCs
          - Replaced our original design of utilizing an arduino for analog to digital conversion to measure voltage and current 
      - Power Subsystem consists of a Step-Down Buck Converter: Utilized to step down the DC-DC voltage to power up 3.3V/5V LEDs, switches, etc. 

  - Does Digital to Analog and Analog to Digital Conversion

  ESP8266
    - Few GPIO pins in which if we utilize a lot of hardware, we will run out of pins
    - 4MB of data storage (unnecessary for our project)
    
Microchip: 
  WINC1500
    - Low power mobile applications
        - Features: Power amplifier, LNA, Switch and Power Management
        - On chip microcontroller and integrated flash memory for system software
        
  Panasonic PAN9520
    Many features that we don't need
      - High performance CPU, high sensitivity wireless radio, baseband processor, etc.
      - Out of stock
      - 2.4 GHz WiFi
      - Supports 20MHz and 40MHz bandwidths in 2.4GHz band 
      

Safety Concerns
    Arc Flashes - Flash Burn and Blast Hazards
    Electric Shock, with particular scrutiny on faulty wiring as well 
    Falls - due to the location itself of the solar panels for this project (ECEB roof)
    Thermal Burn Hazards
    Over-current/voltage - ideally will be directly countered by our interface box 

Some changes to our block diagram
Discuss panel ratings and what input connections will be communicating with our interface box
Designing schematics
