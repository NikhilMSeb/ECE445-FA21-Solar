Isolation between the solar panel side and the microcontroller/components side

Switch in power system - Left open. Needs to be fixed

Isolate the high current traces to one side of the board

Add bigger VIAs for higher current traces

Thicken traces from 12V --- Remove barrel jack, add a screw terminal

High voltage screw terminals for the solar panel side like a 1x04 + a 1x02 for the output load

Thicken power traces

ACS723 needs GND1

Instead of using schottkey diodes, drivers, decoders, inverters, use a darlington array: ULN2003a

Microcontroller pins drive the signal through the darlington (also has flyback diodes to disspitate the instantaneous voltage change) and power the relays.
