Looking at the datasheet for the [ULN2003B Darlington Array](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2003b.pdf?HQS=dis-dk-null-digikeymode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1637441321544&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fgeneral%252Fdocs%252Fsuppproductinfo.tsp%253FdistId%253D10%2526gotoUrl%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Flit%252Fgpn%252Fuln2003b), the input voltage can be around a range of 2.7V to 3V and with the current input resistor value of 2.7k ohms, I wanted to ensure that the Darlington Array could withstand a voltage coming from the ESP32 control signals of around a max of 3.3V. Whilst researching that, I came across different ways that others have utilized the ESP32 and coded it to work with the Darlington Array.
A [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-stepper-motor-28byj-48-uln2003/) I found uses the ESP32 to communicate with the ULN2003a as then to a motor driver. The Darlington has motor drive applications along with driving relays and the latter is what we are specifically utilizing our Darlington Array for. Therefore, we can modify this code to work with 6 Darlington Pairs and drive 6 of our relays.
