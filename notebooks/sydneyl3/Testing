Testing Individual Components

POWER SUBSYSTEM:
    12V Power Supply:
      DC Output 12V - May vary ~12V range
        Step Down Buck Converter (12V to 5V): Constant DC output ~5V range
        Step Down Buck Converter (12V to 3.3V): Constant DC output ~3.3V range
    
MAIN MICROCONTROLLER SUBSYSTEM:
    SWITCHING SUBSYSTEM:
        Relay: Open Circuit Test (4 Different Combinations)
          Input - Solar Panel (DC Input into Relay - DC Output out of Relay)
              DC (128 Cells) - AD Configuration: Open Ckt Voltage = 85.6V +- 2V DC Output w/ Variability
              DC (64 Cells) - BC Configuration: Open Ckt Voltage = 42.8V +- 2V DC Output w/ Variability
              DC (32 Cells) - CD Configuration: Open Ckt Voltage = 21.4V +- 2V DC Output w/ Variability
              DC (0 Cells) - XX Configuration: Open Ckt Voltage = 0V 

Note: Variability means that dependent on certain conditions, this voltage will change (weather, sun exposure, etc)

    MONITORING SUBSYTEM:
        Voltage Divider
           Solar Panel Input: Dependent on which configuration - Output of Relay -> Voltage Divider
           Current Divider goes before the Voltage Divider
              - Voltage Divider: Measures Voltage of the Open Ckt Voltage from the Relay (Expect DC Output w/ Variability)
              - Current Divider: Measures Current of the Cell Configuration - ~mA range (Small DC Current Value w/ Variability)
    
    MANUAL CONFIGURATION: 
        Switches: 
          Testing: Do the switches operate how we expect? 
            Does it change which configuration we have? When the configuration is controlled through software, which one takes precedence?
        
        ESP32 Wireless Microcontroller:
          Does this have Wi-Fi Capability enabled?
          Does it connect to the wireless server that we are creating?
            - Shut down when threshold values are reached 
        
        OLED Display:
          Does the OLED display output real time voltage, current, and temperature values that we are reading through an oscilloscope, through out voltage and current divider?
          
        THERMOCOUPLES:
          Temperature of different areas on the solar panel
