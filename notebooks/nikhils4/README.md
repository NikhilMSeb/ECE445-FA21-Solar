# ECE 445 Lab Notebook: Nikhil Mathew Sebastian 

## 08/26/2021 - 08/29/2021
**Objectives:** Find a team and establish line of communication. Finalize an idea and approach to groupwork, as well as begin working on RFA. 

**Outcome:** Reached out to 3 different teams through their Initial Posts on the class Web Board and discussed their idea, ways to work, and possible improvements. 
By the end of the weekend, I had had multiple email back-and-forths with Maram Safi and Sydney Li and felt the sponsored idea they wanted to pick up - a smart interface box for solar panels - was a good one to work on over the semester.
We decided to form a team of 3 and planned to meet with our sponsor professor - Arijit Banerjee - as soon as possible to nail down the specifics of the project. 

## 09/01/2021
**Objectives:** Meet with project sponsor Professor Arijit Banerjee, and get a better idea of what is expected and how we can proceed

**Outcome:** Following a 30-minute meeting with Professor Banerjee, we took awaythe following key points:
1. While there was a team in a previous semester who worked on this project, we are expected to start from scratch so as to avoid bias and to possibly present a better project 
2. From a hardware point of view, the key was to increase scalability to a sustainable approach that can be applied to all 60 solar panels on the ECEB. We could also incorporate more complex monitoring systems, like CCTV. 
3. From a software point of view, there was one main deliverable - a user-friendly "Hub" through which data can be monitored and the solar panels configured - and one secondary deliverable - a possible data visualization attempt on the data collected that coul;d be publicly displayed
