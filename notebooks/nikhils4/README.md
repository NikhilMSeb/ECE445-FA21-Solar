## 08/26/2021 - 08/29/2021: Team Finding 
**Objectives:** Find a team and establish line of communication. Finalize an idea and approach to groupwork, as well as begin working on RFA. 

**Outcome:** Reached out to 3 different teams through their Initial Posts on the class Web Board and discussed their idea, ways to work, and possible improvements. 
By the end of the weekend, I had had multiple email back-and-forths with Maram Safi and Sydney Li and felt the sponsored idea they wanted to pick up - a smart interface box for solar panels - was a good one to work on over the semester. \
We decided to form a team of 3 and planned to meet with our sponsor professor - Arijit Banerjee - as soon as possible to nail down the specifics of the project. \
Based on our background and knowledge we decided to split the work up, and I will be leading the software side of the project which includes communication to and from the microcontroller, setting up an external server, web development, etc. 

## 09/01/2021: First Meeting with Sponsor Professor
**Objectives:** Meet with project sponsor Professor Arijit Banerjee, and get a better idea of what is expected and how we can proceed

**Outcome:** Following a 30-minute meeting with Professor Banerjee, we took away the following key points about our project:
1. While there was a team in a previous semester who worked on this project, we are expected to start from scratch so as to avoid bias and to possibly present a better project 
2. From a hardware point of view, the key was to increase scalability to a sustainable approach that can be applied to all 60 solar panels on the ECEB. We could also incorporate more complex monitoring systems, like CCTV. 
3. From a software point of view, there was one main deliverable - a user-friendly "Hub" through which data can be monitored and the solar panels configured - and one secondary deliverable - a possible data visualization attempt on the data collected that could be publicly displayed

## 09/02/2021: RFA Completion 
**Objectives:** Complete and submit RFA for our proposed project 

**Outcome:** Following our meeting with Professor Banerjee, my teammates and I did some individual research into possible subsystems and an approaches for our project.
Putting all of this together, I started a Google Doc for us to collaborate together 

## 09/13/2021: Git Set-up
**Objectives**: Set-up Git repository for the team and bring teammates up to speed 

**Outcome:**

## 09/13/2021: First TA Meeting
**Objectives:** Consolidate all the data compiled for the project and prepare it for first TA meeting 

**Outcome:** 

## 09/14/2021 - 09/15/2021: Proposal Completion
**Objectives:** Complete and submit Proposal for our project 

**Outcome:** Building on our initial RFA as well as the material we put together for our first TA meeting and evaluation, my teammates and I 

## 09/17/2021: Follow-up TA Meeting
**Objectives:** Meet with TA Evan and get input on the information collected so far; Nail down any subsystem details possible 

**Outcome:**
